# Game

This project is in it's early days. There are big plans how HTML canvas works I ended up developing a small game with a big roadmap.


## Roadmap

 * Create a "World's record" scoreboard while maintaining "Your personal best"

 * Multiplayer in realtime
    * Ability to create "room" which anyone with a specific link can join
    * All users in the room will participate in the game when the host starts the game
    * Scoreboard is updated live while game is ongoing.

 * Game UX:
    * Move in-game score and level info outside the canvas
    * Improve the UX of when a level goes up
    * Add sound effects


 * Improved graphics:
    * Introduce a real world-like scene
